## About

The bottleneck in software development is moving. AI agents can now write syntactically correct, contextually relevant code from a natural language description. What remains irreducibly human is everything around implementation: understanding the problem deeply, specifying intent precisely, verifying that what was produced is actually correct, and refining until it is truly right.

*Agentic Software Engineering* is a 12-week textbook for engineers making that transition. It teaches the new loop — **Specify → Generate → Verify → Refine** — not as a workflow of AI tools, but as a set of skills that compound and do not expire when the next model is released: problem decomposition, system thinking, critical verification, and judgment under uncertainty.

The book is built around a single running project (a Task Management API) that grows chapter by chapter, from a scope statement to a complete AI-native system — giving readers a concrete, end-to-end illustration of every concept.
