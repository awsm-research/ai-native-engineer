## 4.1 Why Testing Matters

Software testing is the process of executing software with the intent of finding defects. It is not an optional step at the end of development — it is a discipline that runs throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

Testing serves several purposes:

- **Defect detection**: Finding bugs before they reach users
- **Regression prevention**: Ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality
- **Design feedback**: Tests that are hard to write often indicate design problems
- **Documentation**: A well-named test suite describes exactly what a system does
- **Confidence**: A passing test suite gives the team confidence to make changes

The question is not whether to test, but *how* to test effectively given limited time and resources.

---

## 4.2 The Testing Pyramid

The *testing pyramid* ([Cohn, 2009](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/books/succeeding-with-agile-software-development-using-scrum)) describes the ideal distribution of test types:

```
          ┌───────────┐
          │   E2E /   │   Few, slow, fragile — test critical paths only
          │ UI Tests  │
         ┌┴───────────┴┐
         │ Integration  │  Some — test component interactions
         │    Tests     │
        ┌┴──────────────┴┐
        │   Unit Tests    │  Many — fast, isolated, precise
        └────────────────┘
```

**Unit tests** are the foundation: fast, isolated, numerous. They test individual functions or classes in isolation.

**Integration tests** verify that components work correctly together — services calling repositories, API handlers interacting with business logic.

**End-to-end (E2E) tests** exercise the system as a whole, simulating real user interactions. They are slow, brittle, and expensive to maintain — use them sparingly, for critical user journeys only.

This distribution is sometimes called the "1:10:100 rule" — for every E2E test, write ~10 integration tests and ~100 unit tests. The exact ratio varies by system, but the principle holds: favour fast, isolated tests over slow, coupled ones.

## 4.3 Black-Box and White-Box Testing

Testing approaches can be categorised by how much knowledge of the internal implementation the tester uses.

### 4.3.1 Black-Box Testing

In black-box testing, the tester has no knowledge of the internal implementation. Tests are derived entirely from the specification — inputs are provided and outputs are verified against expected behaviour.

**Advantages**: Tests are specification-driven; a new implementation can be tested without modifying the tests; tests reflect user-visible behaviour.

**Techniques:**
- **Equivalence partitioning**: Divide inputs into classes that the system should handle identically. Test one representative from each class.
- **Boundary value analysis**: Test at the boundaries of valid input ranges. Bugs cluster at boundaries (off-by-one errors, empty inputs, maximum values).
- **Decision table testing**: For systems with complex conditional logic, enumerate all combinations of conditions and expected outcomes.

**Example — equivalence partitioning for task priority:**

The system accepts priority values 1–4. Partitions:
- **Valid**: 1, 2, 3, 4
- **Below range**: 0, -1
- **Above range**: 5, 100
- **Non-integer**: "high", 2.5, None

Test one value from each partition: `priority=2` (valid), `priority=0` (below), `priority=5` (above), `priority="high"` (non-integer).

### 4.3.2 White-Box Testing

In white-box testing (also called structural or glass-box testing), the tester has full knowledge of the internal implementation. Tests are derived from the source code, with the goal of exercising specific paths, branches, and conditions.

**Techniques:**
- **Statement coverage**: Every statement is executed by at least one test
- **Branch coverage**: Every branch (if/else, loop) is executed in both directions
- **Path coverage**: Every possible path through the code is executed (often infeasible for complex code)

White-box testing is particularly valuable for finding dead code, unreachable branches, and logic errors that black-box tests might miss.

## 4.4 Unit Testing with pytest

Unit tests verify the behaviour of a single unit of code — typically a function or method — in isolation from its dependencies.

### 4.4.1 Writing Your First Tests

```python
# src/task_service.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import date
from uuid import UUID, uuid4


class TaskValidationError(ValueError):
    pass


@dataclass
class Task:
    id: UUID
    title: str
    priority: int  # 1–4
    due_date: date | None = None
    status: str = "open"


def create_task(title: str, priority: int, due_date: date | None = None) -> Task:
    """Create a new task with validation."""
    if not title or not title.strip():
        raise TaskValidationError("Title cannot be empty")
    if priority not in range(1, 5):
        raise TaskValidationError(f"Priority must be 1–4, got {priority}")
    if due_date and due_date < date.today():
        raise TaskValidationError("Due date cannot be in the past")
    return Task(id=uuid4(), title=title.strip(), priority=priority, due_date=due_date)
```

```python
# tests/test_task_service.py
import pytest
from datetime import date, timedelta
from src.task_service import create_task, TaskValidationError


class TestCreateTask:
    def test_creates_task_with_valid_inputs(self) -> None:
        task = create_task("Write tests", priority=2)
        assert task.title == "Write tests"
        assert task.priority == 2
        assert task.status == "open"
        assert task.id is not None

    def test_strips_whitespace_from_title(self) -> None:
        task = create_task("  Write tests  ", priority=1)
        assert task.title == "Write tests"

    def test_raises_for_empty_title(self) -> None:
        with pytest.raises(TaskValidationError, match="Title cannot be empty"):
            create_task("", priority=1)

    def test_raises_for_whitespace_only_title(self) -> None:
        with pytest.raises(TaskValidationError):
            create_task("   ", priority=1)

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("priority", [0, -1, 5, 100])
    def test_raises_for_invalid_priority(self, priority: int) -> None:
        with pytest.raises(TaskValidationError, match="Priority must be 1–4"):
            create_task("Valid title", priority=priority)

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("priority", [1, 2, 3, 4])
    def test_accepts_valid_priorities(self, priority: int) -> None:
        task = create_task("Valid title", priority=priority)
        assert task.priority == priority

    def test_raises_for_past_due_date(self) -> None:
        yesterday = date.today() - timedelta(days=1)
        with pytest.raises(TaskValidationError, match="Due date cannot be in the past"):
            create_task("Valid title", priority=1, due_date=yesterday)

    def test_accepts_future_due_date(self) -> None:
        tomorrow = date.today() + timedelta(days=1)
        task = create_task("Valid title", priority=1, due_date=tomorrow)
        assert task.due_date == tomorrow

    def test_accepts_no_due_date(self) -> None:
        task = create_task("Valid title", priority=1)
        assert task.due_date is None
```

Run the tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test_task_service.py -v
```

### 4.4.2 Fixtures

Fixtures are reusable setup functions that provide test dependencies. They replace repetitive setup code and enable dependency injection in tests.

```python
# tests/conftest.py
import pytest
from uuid import uuid4
from datetime import date, timedelta
from src.task_service import Task
from src.repository import InMemoryTaskRepository


@pytest.fixture
def repository() -> InMemoryTaskRepository:
    return InMemoryTaskRepository()


@pytest.fixture
def sample_task() -> Task:
    return Task(
        id=uuid4(),
        title="Sample task",
        priority=2,
        due_date=date.today() + timedelta(days=7),
    )
```

```python
# tests/test_repository.py
from uuid import uuid4
from src.task_service import Task
from src.repository import InMemoryTaskRepository


def test_save_and_retrieve_task(
    repository: InMemoryTaskRepository, sample_task: Task
) -> None:
    repository.save(sample_task)
    retrieved = repository.find_by_id(sample_task.id)
    assert retrieved == sample_task


def test_returns_none_for_missing_task(repository: InMemoryTaskRepository) -> None:
    result = repository.find_by_id(uuid4())
    assert result is None


def test_delete_removes_task(
    repository: InMemoryTaskRepository, sample_task: Task
) -> None:
    repository.save(sample_task)
    repository.delete(sample_task.id)
    assert repository.find_by_id(sample_task.id) is None
```

### 4.4.3 Mocking

When a unit under test depends on external systems (databases, email services, APIs), mocking replaces those dependencies with controlled substitutes.

```python
# tests/test_assignment_service.py
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch
from uuid import uuid4
from src.assignment_service import AssignmentService
from src.task_service import Task


def test_assign_task_sends_notification() -> None:
    # Arrange
    mock_repo = MagicMock()
    mock_notifier = MagicMock()
    service = AssignmentService(repo=mock_repo, notifier=mock_notifier)

    task_id = uuid4()
    mock_repo.find_by_id.return_value = Task(
        id=task_id, title="Test task", priority=1
    )

    # Act
    service.assign(task_id=task_id, assignee_email="alice@example.com")

    # Assert
    mock_repo.save.assert_called_once()
    mock_notifier.notify.assert_called_once_with(
        recipient="alice@example.com",
        subject="You have been assigned a task",
    )
```

---

## 4.5 Code Coverage

Code coverage measures how much of your source code is executed by your test suite. It is a useful indicator of untested areas, but it is not a measure of test quality.

```bash
pip install pytest-cov
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

Sample output:
```
Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
---------------------------------------------------------
src/task_service.py          18      2    89%   34-35
src/repository.py            22      0   100%
src/assignment_service.py    15      3    80%   28, 41-42
---------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                        55      5    91%
```

The `Missing` column shows which lines are not covered — useful for targeting additional tests.

**Coverage targets**: 80% is a common minimum threshold for production code. 100% coverage is neither necessary nor sufficient — you can have 100% coverage with tests that make no meaningful assertions.

**What coverage cannot tell you**:
- Whether the tests assert the *right* things
- Whether edge cases are tested (a line can be covered by a single happy-path test)
- Whether the system behaves correctly at the integration level

---

## 4.6 Code Quality and Static Analysis

Beyond testing, several automated tools catch quality issues before code review.

### 4.6.1 Linting with Ruff

Ruff (introduced in Chapter 1) enforces style rules and catches common programming errors:

```bash
ruff check src/
ruff format src/
```

Ruff subsumes the functionality of flake8, isort, and black, and is significantly faster than any of them individually.

### 4.6.2 Type Checking with mypy

Type annotations in Python (since PEP 484, [van Rossum et al., 2015](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/)) enable static analysis. mypy verifies that type annotations are consistent throughout the codebase, catching a class of bugs that tests can miss.

```bash
mypy src/ --strict
```

Common errors mypy catches:
- Passing `None` where a non-optional value is expected
- Calling a method that does not exist on a type
- Returning the wrong type from a function
- Missing return statements

### 4.6.3 Security Scanning with Bandit

Bandit ([PyCQA, 2014](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) scans Python code for common security vulnerabilities:

```bash
pip install bandit
bandit -r src/
```

Bandit flags issues like SQL injection risks, hardcoded passwords, use of weak cryptographic algorithms, and unsafe deserialization. Security scanning is covered in depth in Chapter 9.

## 4.7 Pull Requests and Code Review

Before code reaches the main branch, it passes through two gates: a *pull request* (PR), which is the mechanism for proposing and discussing a change, and *code review*, which is the human evaluation of that change. Together they are among the most effective defect-detection and knowledge-sharing practices in software engineering ([Fagan, 1976](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1702601); [Rigby & Bird, 2013](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2491411.2491428)).

### 4.7.1 What Is a Pull Request?

A pull request is a request to merge a set of commits from one branch into another — typically from a feature branch into `main`. It serves as a structured checkpoint that combines:

- **Change visibility**: a diff showing exactly what changed and why
- **Discussion space**: a thread where reviewers can ask questions, raise concerns, and suggest improvements
- **Automated gate**: a trigger for CI checks (tests, linting, security scans) that must pass before merging
- **Audit trail**: a permanent record of what was changed, who reviewed it, and what was discussed

PRs are not just a technical mechanism — they are a communication artefact. A well-written PR description gives reviewers the context they need to evaluate the change without having to reconstruct it from the diff.

### 4.7.2 Why Pull Requests Matter

Without a PR discipline, several things tend to go wrong:

- **Bugs accumulate**: changes that look correct in isolation often reveal problems only when another developer reads them with fresh eyes
- **Knowledge silos form**: when code is never reviewed, only the author understands it
- **Standards drift**: without a review gate, style, architecture, and quality standards erode incrementally
- **Security vulnerabilities ship**: many common vulnerabilities (injection, broken auth, unsafe defaults) are easy to catch in review and expensive to fix in production

The PR process imposes a small cost per change — typically 30–60 minutes of reviewer time — in exchange for substantially lower defect rates and better collective code ownership.

### 4.7.3 Writing an Effective Pull Request

A good PR is small, focused, and self-explanatory. The title and description should answer three questions:

1. **What changed?** — a one-line summary that a reader can understand without opening the diff
2. **Why?** — the motivation: the bug being fixed, the requirement being met, the tech debt being addressed
3. **How should reviewers test it?** — the steps to verify the change works as intended

```markdown
## What
Add pagination to the task list endpoint (`GET /tasks`).

## Why
The endpoint currently returns all tasks in a single response. With >10,000 tasks 
in staging, response times exceed 5 s and memory usage spikes. Fixes #142.

## How to test
1. Run `pytest tests/test_task_endpoint.py -k pagination`
2. Manually: `curl "localhost:8000/tasks?page=2&page_size=20"` — should return 
   tasks 21–40 with `X-Total-Count` header set correctly.
3. Edge case: `page=0` should return HTTP 422.
```

**Keep PRs small.** A PR touching 10 files is reviewed carefully; a PR touching 50 files is rubber-stamped. Aim for changes that can be reviewed in under 20 minutes. If a feature requires large changes, break it into sequential PRs: data model first, then business logic, then API layer.

### 4.7.4 The Code Review Process

Code review is the practice of having another developer read and evaluate your code before it is merged. A standard review cycle proceeds as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Author opens PR] --> B[CI runs automatically\ntests · lint · type check · security scan]
    B --> C{CI passes?}
    C -- No --> D[Author fixes failures] --> B
    C -- Yes --> E[Reviewer reads diff and description]
    E --> F[Leaves inline comments\nmust-fix · suggestion · question]
    F --> G[Author responds to all comments\nand makes changes]
    G --> H{Reviewer satisfied?}
    H -- No --> F
    H -- Yes --> I[Reviewer approves]
    I --> J[PR merged\nsquash or merge commit]
```

### 4.7.5 What to Look for in a Code Review

An effective reviewer checks:

- **Correctness**: Does the code do what the description claims? Are there edge cases the author missed?
- **Tests**: Are there sufficient tests? Do they cover the important cases, not just the happy path?
- **Design**: Does the change fit the existing architecture? Does it introduce unnecessary coupling or complexity?
- **Security**: Does the change introduce any security vulnerabilities? (See Chapter 5.)
- **Readability**: Can you understand the code without asking the author?
- **Performance**: Are there obvious performance issues — N+1 queries, unbounded loops, unnecessary allocations?

Reviewers are not responsible for finding every bug — that is what tests are for. The goal is a second pair of eyes that catches what the author's familiarity with their own code conceals.

### 4.7.6 Code Review Etiquette

Effective code review requires clear, respectful communication:

- Review the code, not the person: "This function is hard to follow" not "You wrote this poorly"
- Be specific: "Line 42: extracting this into a helper function would make it easier to test" not "this is messy"
- Distinguish must-fix from suggestions: prefix non-blocking suggestions with "nit:" or "optional:"
- Respond to all review comments, even briefly: "agreed, fixed" or "I disagree because X — open to discussion"
- Approve when it is good enough to ship, not when it is perfect

### 4.7.7 Automated Code Review

AI-powered tools (GitHub Copilot code review, CodeRabbit, Sourcery) can perform a first-pass review, catching mechanical issues before human reviewers see the code. These tools are most effective at:

- Identifying obvious bugs and null pointer issues
- Suggesting more idiomatic patterns
- Flagging inconsistency with the surrounding codebase
- Checking for common security anti-patterns

They are least effective at:
- Understanding business context and domain logic
- Evaluating architectural decisions
- Catching subtle security vulnerabilities that require domain knowledge
- Judging whether a change is the *right* change

Use automated review as a pre-filter, not a replacement for human review. Run it before the human reviewer sees the PR so reviewers can focus on what tools cannot catch.

---

## 4.8 Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer branches into the main branch frequently — at least daily — with each merge triggering an automated build and test run ([Fowler, 2006](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)).

Continuous delivery (CD) extends CI to ensure that the software is always in a deployable state. Every passing build is a release candidate.

### 4.8.1 GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub. Workflows are defined as YAML files in `.github/workflows/`.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run linter
        run: ruff check src/ tests/

      - name: Run type checker
        run: mypy src/ --strict

      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=80

      - name: Run security scan
        run: bandit -r src/ -ll

      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
        with:
          file: ./coverage.xml
```

This workflow runs on every push to `main` and on every pull request. It will fail if:
- The linter finds any issues
- The type checker finds any errors
- Any test fails
- Code coverage drops below 80%
- Bandit finds any medium or higher severity issues

A failing CI pipeline blocks the pull request from being merged, enforcing quality standards automatically.

### 4.8.2 Branch Protection

Configuring branch protection ensures no code reaches the main branch without passing all automated checks.

**GitHub**

1. Repository Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
2. Add a rule for `main`
3. Enable: "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Select the CI workflow checks
5. Optionally enable "Require approvals" to enforce peer review before merge

**GitLab**

1. Settings → Repository → Protected Branches
2. Add `main` as a protected branch
3. Set "Allowed to merge" to *Maintainers* (or your team's policy)
4. Set "Allowed to push" to *No one* to prevent direct pushes
5. Navigate to Settings → CI/CD → General pipelines and enable "Pipelines must succeed" under Merge Requests
6. Optionally set "Require approval from code owners" under Settings → Merge Requests

### Running the Full Quality Suite Locally

```bash
# Run all checks in order
ruff check src/ tests/          # Linting
ruff format --check src/ tests/ # Formatting
mypy src/ --strict              # Type checking
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src \

  --cov-fail-under=80           # Tests + coverage
bandit -r src/ -ll              # Security scan
```

Add a `Makefile` to run all checks with one command:

```makefile
# Makefile
.PHONY: check test lint typecheck security

check: lint typecheck test security

lint:
	ruff check src/ tests/
	ruff format --check src/ tests/

typecheck:
	mypy src/ --strict

test:
